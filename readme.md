# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++. Players take turns to make moves on a 3x3 board until a player wins or the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- Two-player mode.
- Player input for detnality.
- Proper checking for ermining the starting player.
- Clear screen functiovalid moves.
- Clear and concise code structure.

## How to Play

1. Player 1 will be prompted to choose heads (h) or tails (t) to determine the starting player.
2. The starting player is assigned 'X', and the other player gets 'O'.
3. Players take turns entering positions on the board (1-9).
4. The game continues until a player wins or the board is filled (resulting in a draw).

## Code Organization

- `main.cpp`: The main file containing the game loop and user interactions.

## Dependencies

The code uses standard C++ libraries and should be compatible with most C++ compilers.
